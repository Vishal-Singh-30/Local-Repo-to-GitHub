# Local Repository to GitHub ->
1. Use " git init " command to convert local repo to git repo so that git can track its changes. 
2. Now you can make changes or add file in your local directory. 
3. Add and commit these changes.
4. Now we want to upload local repo to GitHub. 
5. Create a new git repo using GitHub
    - Copy its HTTPS link
    - use command git remote add origin main <-LINK->  
        - // this tells where we want to  push our local repo.
    - To verify git remote -> git remote -v
6. Use git push to push the local repo to the link.
